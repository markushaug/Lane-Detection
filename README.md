# Introduction

Over the past few years, computer vision and robotics have become increasingly important, for example in autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with a large number of different sensors and cameras in order to analyse their physical environment in detail. This is essential, because the decision of the vehicle is based on its perception. 
In order to keep the vehicle in the lane, it is necessary to analyse the road surface. Due to marked coloured lines the evaluation of these lines is possible. A camera is used for this purpose, which transmits a live image to the respective control unit. By means of mathematical algorithms, which will be explained later on, it is possible to graphically visualise the road lines.
